# Meta<sup>2</sup>

Meta<sup>2</sup> (pronounced "meta square") is the second iteration of the Meta control agent by GPU Exchange.

This version is a full rewrite in Go (aka. Golang) and comes with the following benefits over the original NodeJS version:

* Simplified atomic deployment (only one executable file)
* More reliable state management for miners
* Reduced resource consumption
* CLI dashboard for remote administration over SSH (no browser required)
